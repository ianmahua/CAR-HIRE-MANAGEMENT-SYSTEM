# 🎉 YOUR SYSTEM IS STARTING!

## ✅ What I Just Did:

1. ✅ Started Backend Server (port 5000)
2. ✅ Started Frontend Server (port 3000)

## 🌐 OPEN THIS IN YOUR BROWSER:

### **http://localhost:3000**

*(Wait 30-60 seconds if it doesn't load immediately - the frontend is compiling)*

## 🔐 LOGIN CREDENTIALS:

- **Email:** `admin@ressytours.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`

## 📋 What You Should See:

Two PowerShell windows opened:
1. **Backend Server** - Shows "Server running on port 5000"
2. **Frontend Server** - Shows "Compiled successfully!" when ready

## ⏱️ Wait Time:

- Backend: Ready immediately ✅
- Frontend: Takes 30-60 seconds to compile ⏳

## 🔍 If It Doesn't Work:

1. **Check the PowerShell windows** - Look for error messages
2. **Wait a bit longer** - Frontend compilation takes time
3. **Try refreshing** the browser after 60 seconds

## ✅ Quick Test:

Test backend first: http://localhost:5000/api/health
(Should show: {"status":"OK","message":"CRMS API is running"})

Then open: http://localhost:3000
